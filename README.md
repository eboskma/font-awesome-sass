# FontAwesome::Sass

'font-awesome-sass' is a Sass-powered version of FontAwesome for your Bower projects. 
 
 Documentation humbly used from the excellent [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) 
 project by the Bootstrap team 

## Installation

Install with Bower

```sh
bower install font-awesome-sass
```

Import the FontAwesome styles

```scss
@import "path/to/bower_components/font-awesome-sass/font-awesome";
```

## Aknowledgements

This is nothing more than a refactor of the [font-awesome-sass](https://github.com/FortAwesome/font-awesome-sass)
Ruby gem. I merely stripped the Ruby/Compass specific elements, reordered some files and added bower.json to the
repository.
